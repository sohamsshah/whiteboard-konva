So when you go back to all you have to do is take notes, turn the call, the system will go to work, it will transcribe, it will pull the video and then it will pop out.",

Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right.

All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly.

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

      " and even while taking the interview, eso roughly what goes on in my mind is a okay. Like, let's say I have these six areas that I have to cover. All right, Let's say I mean just taking a very wild analogy. If you're talking about like football or something like that, then I'd be like, OK, there's attack. There's difference. There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",

There's, like, whatever midfield and whatnot Warner. So there's roughly these six areas that I have to cover. So maybe I'll just, like, take the finance and allegedly, right? Like for if I'm talking to a particular business, I want to understand about how money is coming into their business, how money is going out of their business on then, how they're keeping the books on. Then there's like how they were doing their taxes and their GSD and all like, uh, complaints. And then there is how, like, Let's say they invest their money and what kind of metrics help them to make better financial decisions. So these are roughly six or seven categories off information that I look for. Okay, okay, on. Obviously, this is again probably very in the mid to a very formative kind of a resource that I'm doing on. Then what I do is I get into a conversation and I'm like, Okay, like, uh, start off it off a bit about your business and then, like, let's let's Okay, now, then I understand if it's a marketplace kind of a business, then and be like, OK, so then marketplace. How How is your receivables game kind of structure? Right? And then they start talking about it. And most of my questions initially are, you know, leading questions that kind off, make the person go by their invite it okay into that particular area. And then if I encounter something where I feel like I need toe dive deeper, dive deeper, and then the school kind of narrows, right? So I have these rough six areas that I want to cover on while covering them. Uh, there are already like, let's say, a set off, like 10 problems or opportunities that have identified before. Okay, All right. So, for example, I know that paying, like calculating your tedious when you're a marketplace is like a huge problem. Just random problem, right? So when I'm talking about tedious like, let's say, if I have, like 15 minutes allotted for serious based conversation, I take like, let's say, 12 minutes to just open endedly. Talk about tedious, okay? And then in the last three or five minutes, I also validated this problem. Uh, that hypothesis that I already have, like, if it hasn't come up in the conversation already. All right, So that part is also there s o usually one on one interviews. That is how I structure them on. And also the kind of research cause that I'm doing right now are quite formative. Very open ended. There's no particular aim to them except, like maybe, you know, find out new avenues for the product for, like, growth, etcetera. Right. So considering that it's pretty open and there and I'm doing number like non customers, Hmm. Uh, August, you're going?",
